# EucliGeo
Welcome to EucliGeo, an interactive learning platform designed to help learners engage with Euclidean Geometry through computational thinking skills. This website supports enhancing problem-solving skills by guiding users through geometric theorems in a visual and step-by-step manner.

## Key Features

**Interactive Diagrams**: The user can explore and manipulate various geometric diagrams to enhance their understanding of relationships between angles, lines, and shapes.

**GeoGebra Integration**: The embedded GeoGebra tools allow for the dynamic decomposition of geometric diagrams, enabling users to break down complex diagrams into simpler and more manageable sub-diagrams.

**Problem-Solving Strategy**: The users are also presented with a structured approach to solving geometry problems, helping them develop their computational thinking skills.

**User Guidance**: Users are provided with clear guidance throughout the learning process, ensuring they know which sides or angles to focus on rather than having to guess.

## Purpose
This platform integrates computational thinking with Euclidean Geometry to enhance learner's problem-solving skills, particularly in South African high schools. It leverages visual tools and structured strategies to make abstract concepts more accessible and engaging.

## How to use
The website consists of 4 main web pages; each has its own content the user can interact with. Below is the use of each web page:

**Examples**: This web page has some examples the user can click on and try to solve while the given guidance on how to solve computational thinking concepts. Every problem starts with the **abstraction step**, followed by **decomposition**, then **pattern recognition**, and finally **solving the problem** using all the information from the previous steps.

**Definitions**: Users can try to understand the geometric terms, definitions, and properties of shapes through this page. 

**Theorems**: Theorems are at the core of Euclidean Geometry; if you don't understand the theorems, you cannot solve Euclidean Geometric problems. This page provides users with interactive diagrams that can be manipulated to learn each theorem better and understand what happens when some changes are made to it. The angles can be shown and hidden, the radius can be increased and decreased, and the sides' lengths can be changed.

**Approach**: A user is given an algorithmic problem-solving strategy they can use to help them solve these problems.
